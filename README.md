# ENCRYPTO
This is a very basic word encryption &amp; decryption tool. When you are using this application on several computers, and passing encrypted or decrypted messages via notepad text files 
make sure that encrypted and decrypted text files are saved in a notepad by using Unicode encoding. Not as an ANSI encoding.

IMPORTANT : Don not use more than one number as the cipher key.
            Example :  key one :   1,
                       key two :   0,
                       key three : 1
